### As a repair shop, handing out quotes is probably something that you find yourself doing all the time.  It gets repetitive and most of the times can be a distraction from more important work that needs to be done to keep the business thriving.  One way to cut back on all of this time is by developing a custom quote system that can accomodate for a large percentage of the devices you find yourself repairing for clients.

### This site was developed with the intentions of creating and integrating a custom quote modal that could achieve these feats and save business owners time and money.

### Users can obtain a free quote by clicking on the "Free Quote" button on the top right of the homepage, which pulls up the 6 quote modals, each of which is configured independently as it's own database table and schema, allowing for more flexibility and customization between product lines.  Each quote modal is comprised of a custom object which stores the integral details related to the object, such as Manufacturer, model, repair type, price, etcetera.

### Customers are able to keep track of the quote system progress with the help of a progress bar which represents the progress in the form of a percentage.
