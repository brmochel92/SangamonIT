As a repair shop, handing out quotes is probably something that you find yourself doing all the time.  It gets repetitive and most of the times can be a distraction from more important work that needs to be done to keep the business thriving.  One way to cut back on all of this time is by developing a custom quote system that can accomodate for a large percentage of the devices you find yourself repairing for clients.

This site was developed with the intentions of creating and integrating a custom quote modal that could achieve these feats and save business owners time and money.

Users can obtain a free quote by clicking on the "Free Quote" button on the top right of the homepage, which pulls up the 6 quote modals, each of which is configured independently as it's own database table and schema, allowing for more flexibility and customization between product lines.  Each quote modal is comprised of a custom object which stores the integral details related to the object, such as Manufacturer, model, repair type, price, etcetera.  

Customers are able to keep track of the quote system progress with the help of a progress bar which represents the progress in the form of a percentage.
